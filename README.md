## Project description
The objective of this mini-project is to show an example of a readable, extensible, and maintainable project with 
automated API tests that you can use as a foundation for building your own.\
It can also help beginners and not quite beginner automation engineers to get rid of many questions like:
 * How to validate response?
 * How to add logging?
 * How to implement a reporting mechanism?
